# Idle-Token-Based-Load-Balancing
Establishing new load balancing techniques based on timing and synchronization of recently idled servers. Also, self-implementing, simulating, and optimizing some commonly used algorithms in the load balancing world like JSQ, JIQ, and Persistent Idle (PI). Project supervised by NSSL Lab (Networked Software Systems) at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Technion.
